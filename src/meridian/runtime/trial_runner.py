"""The trial lifecycle — the heart of Rule 1.

The lifecycle is fixed and the ordering is load-bearing:

    resolve → create → start → materialize → wait → extract → destroy → grade

Extraction happens **before** removal and inside the same `try`. Destruction
happens in a `finally`, unconditionally, and whether it succeeded is recorded —
a leaked container is a harness error, not a silent condition. Grading happens
outside the container, against extracted state, so a compromised agent cannot
influence its own verdict.
